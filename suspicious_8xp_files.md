The "*.8xp" file is a proprietary file that can only be read and created by TI software/hardware, such as calculators and TI Connect

This file is guarenteed to be safe because it contains TI-BASIC hex tokens. It cannot be run as an executable in any way.

Infact any file extension that is "*.8x?" (? is any letter) is specific to the TI Graphing calculator family.

This means that there is literally no way to get any virus with this file extension unless you change it. 

If it is a virus, then it cannot be read.
