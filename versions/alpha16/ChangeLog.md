What has changed from Alpha13 to Alpha16?
Why are you jumping between numbers?

First question:
     
     [1] "AntiBreak"
          [a] No strings greater than 25 characters (prevents roll over)
          [b] No more theta, which would break the AI almost instantly...
     [2] Identifiers
          [a] User is now seperated from AI 
          [b] User: "]*message*" System: ">*message*" AntiBreak: "}*string*"
     [3] Other things
          [a] L2N module has greatly increased speed (for character repeats)
          [b] Added AutoClean for storage space stuff

Second question: 
     
     I am not always by my computer, so I don't always upload the code. 
     Anyway, any change is a new Alpha version and therefore many updates combined will be better off
     
The broke bug is still present, you can see how to fix in the root folder :)
